# Hangman

Through the game, hangman, we hope that the user gets to learn several new words, and improve his/her vocabulary. Each time he/she comes across a new word, he'll/sheâ€™ll be tempted to check its meaning, and put it in use as he interacts with the language. This game will also help the user know where their vocabulary stands, and how much they have to improve it, as all the words used are very basic and are used commonly. Enjoy!

The structure of the code is made adhering to the common facets of functional programming. It is written entirely in C++.

Some improvements that could be made to the code structure are as follows:

1. Proper modules can be added for different sections of the overall code logic.
2. Higher-level languages can be experimented with so that a simplistic GUI can be made hand-in-hand to make the application more interactive.
3. Code hygiene may be improved in certain places of the code.

This repository welcomes any contributions or refactoring to the code. Please make an issue and you can take it up there with the original creator of the repo.
